Title: Interprocess Data Sharing Between R Sessions
Version: 0.0.4
Authors@R: person("Kun", "Ren", , "ken@renkun.me", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A simple toolbox to share data between R sessions without having to
    explicitly save data to a physical location. Any serializable R object can be
    shared to a system-wide memory pool from which other R sessions can make copies
    of the object.
